# FaceVote Precision

## Introduction 🔍
FaceVote Precision (FVP) is an online voting system designed to make elections easier and more secure by using face recognition. It aims to speed up vote counting, reduce costs, and improve accessibility for disabled voters.

## Objectives 🎯
- Authenticity: Use face recognition with the Haarcascade algorithm in OpenCV to ensure voter and vote authenticity.
- Accessibility: Enhance voting accessibility through internet connectivity.
- Integrity: Prevent vote tampering during counting using the NumPy library.

## Technology Stack 💻
## Frontend:
- Tkinter: For developing the graphical user interface.
- Python 3.11.0: Integrated development environment.
## Backend:
- MySQL: Database management system.
- MySQL Connector: Connects Python applications to MySQL databases.
- OpenCV: For implementing face recognition.
- NumPy: For secure vote counting. 

## Project Outcomes 🎯
- User Authentication 🔐: Securely verifies voter identities.
- Database Management 📂: Efficiently manages voting data.
- Image-Based Identification 🖼️: Utilizes face recognition for voter authentication.
- Real-Time Identification 🕰️: Provides quick and accurate voter verification.
